# cs-url-paths

STEP 1
Change language codes
Sofia wants to help users navigate around the Khan Academy site by constructing URLs to different pages.

The site offers content in several languages, indicated in the URL by a language code like es or pt. Sofia often uses the Portuguese site at pt, but she wants her program to show the Spanish site by default.

Modify the first assignment statement to assign the value "es" to the variable language_code.
Youâ€™ll need to replace the value "pt" with the value "es". When the program accesses language_code to construct the url, it should contain the value "es".
